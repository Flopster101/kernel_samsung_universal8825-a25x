        help
          Using eSE platform driver.
          Sometimes eSE node is created after permission setting
          cause of SPI driver dependency.
          So, use platform driver to make node first.

	  Say Y here to compile support for TZ API.

config SEC_NFC_LOGGER
        bool "NFC logger"
        default n
        help
          Enable NFC log.
          NFC log will be recorded at proc folder.
          but will not included at dumpstate log.
          so need to copy this file to log folder.
